# Backend server

The backend server is written in C++ because I've always wanted to learn to write a simple WebServer in C++. This will be ideal for embedded devices or VPS with limited memory. I'm also experimenting with protobuf because I wanted to learn more about it.

## Requirements

- CMake
- GCC/G++ or Clang with support for C++17
- Protobuf compiler
- sqlite3
